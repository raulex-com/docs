# ðŸšª Adding a new door

### Step 1: Use the in-game tool&#x20;

Use the <mark style="color:orange;">RaulexKeyCardRoomsConverter</mark> which can be spawned in from your admin menu and use it on any door to add a new door to your config.&#x20;

### Step 2: Edit the new door

Once you have used the **tool** on any **door**, a **new entry** for door will be automatically **added** to your **config**.\
\
**Download** your **App config** again from your **console** to see the **new entry**. Then you may edit the door config according to your requirements. Refer [#understanding-door-schema](adding-a-new-door.md#understanding-door-schema "mention").\
